The instructor may cover these items any time during the semester. \r\n\r\n*Please note: \r\nEach item presented below doesn’t denote a 50 min class session. They \r\nare just the list of topics that we will be covering. While some items \r\nmight take a meagre 20 mins (eg., item 3 takes less than 20 mins) some \r\nof them may take more than 2 to 3 classes (eg., item 31 takes 2 hours or\r\n more to cover).*\r\n\r\n \r\n| Sl.
